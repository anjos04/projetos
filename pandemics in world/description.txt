Data description:

Disease outbreaks may be inevitable, but large-scale pandemics are not. The world can respond swiftly and effectively to pandemic risks in the future with better understanding, resources, and effort.

To avoid suffering through another large pandemic, we have to take the risk of pandemics seriously. Despite warnings that another one was likely, the COVID-19 pandemic killed more than 27 million people.1

We must build the capacity to test for pathogens and understand them: which pathogens put us at the greatest risk, how they spread, and how to tackle them.

We know it is possible to greatly reduce the risk of infectious disease. We’ve learned over history how to reduce their impact with vaccines, public health efforts, and medicine.

In addition to the old risks, we face new threats from factory farming, genetic modification, climate change, and antimicrobial resistance. With more attention and effort, we can reduce their risks too.

Good luck in your analysis.
